This file only concerns itself with porting KolourPaint from KDE 3 to KDE 4
and code cleanups.

Features to be implemented are in branches/kolourpaint/control/TODO.


0. Move stuff from Clarence's USB disk into this.

1. Move all code that accesses document content to imagelib/.
   Do a case-insensitive grep for "mask" or case-sensitive grep for QBitmap.

   Examples:

   * imagelib/transforms/{kptoolcrop,kptoolautocrop}.cpp should only contain
     the QPixmap manipulation code

   * The part of kpToolClearCommand::execute() manipulating the mask should be moved
     into imagelib/

2. Move all dialogs to dialogs/

3. Move all commands to commands/

4. Fix tools/polygonal class hierarchy

5. Fix tools/selection class hierarchy

6. Rename files to match classes.  Make sure each file contains just one
   public class. e.g. kpToolFlip.cpp contains class kpToolFlip but can also
   contain MyPrivateHelperClass.  Note the casing of the file - I'm
   getting sick of kpawholebunchofwordsstucktogetherwithnoseparators.cpp.
   Start migrating all files to CamelCase.

12. Remove deprecated qt3support and kde3support references.


7. Remove "Thanks To" section in kolourpaint.cpp - it's simply extra work to
   coordinate with website updates, esp. during release freezes where updates
   are not allowed.


11. Push as many classes as possible into kdelibs.


9. Review all commits.  Credit people like Laurent Montel for porting.

10. QA entire project due to Qt4 breakages.  Everything needs to be whitebox
    tested again esp. the file saving path - format conversion, maximal
    content preservation, formatting loss warnings etc.
