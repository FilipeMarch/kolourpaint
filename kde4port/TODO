This file only concerns itself with porting KolourPaint from KDE 3 to KDE 4
and code cleanups.  TODO: we broke this rule at the bottom of the file and
started talking about features.

Features to be implemented are in branches/kolourpaint/control/TODO.


1. Move all code that accesses document content to imagelib/.  Merge with kppixmapfx.cpp.
   Do a case-insensitive grep for "mask" or case-sensitive grep for QBitmap.

   Examples:

   * imagelib/transforms/{kptoolcrop,kptoolautocrop}.cpp should only contain
     the QPixmap manipulation code

   * The part of kpToolClearCommand::execute() manipulating the mask should be moved
     into imagelib/

2. Move all dialogs to dialogs/

3. Move all commands to commands/

4. Fix tools/polygonal class hierarchy

5. Fix tools/selection class hierarchy

6. Rename files to match classes.  Make sure each file contains just one
   public class. e.g. kpToolFlip.cpp contains class kpToolFlip but can also
   contain MyPrivateHelperClass.  Note the casing of the file - I'm
   getting sick of kpawholebunchofwordsstucktogetherwithnoseparators.cpp.
   Start migrating all files to CamelCase.

12. Remove deprecated qt3support and kde3support references.


7. Remove "Thanks To" section in kolourpaint.cpp - it's simply extra work to
   coordinate with website updates, esp. during release freezes where updates
   are not allowed.


11. Push as many classes as possible into kdelibs.
* reduce size of code (51352-28 generated lines 2006-03-23; hopefully reduce by 10KLOC)
  - go through each class finding stuff that can be factored into kdelibs
    (also go through bug reports), SYNC, HACK, COMPAT etc.
  - push kpSqueezedTextLabel
  - push kpCommandHistory out; now Qt has some command scheme in addition to
    kdelibs, koffice and kolourpaint; see kde-core-devel for yet another
command scheme
  - push multicolumn toolbar out (see how rodda's KAction changes affect it
- ask rodda)
    - ktoolbar support multicolumn - see how krita does it


9. Review all commits.  Credit people like Laurent Montel for porting.
   Look in this folder.

10. QA entire project due to Qt4 breakages.  Everything needs to be whitebox
    tested again esp. the file saving path - format conversion, maximal
    content preservation, formatting loss warnings etc.

13. Profile startup time

* KParts (see bug report by zrusin)
  - import-export for KOffice & KolourPaint
    - look up thread in mail where I said I'd rename to "Save A Copy" etc.
  - oldURL for error handling in general
* smarter text tool
* DPI GUI to close bug
  - View / Actual Size != actual size - rename to 100%
    but View / 100% looks weird, View / Unzoomed (100%) looks weird and
    confused with Zoomed Thumbnail Mode

* patches lying around
* make KolourPaint fun to use & popular again by implementing easy feature
  requests quickly
  - e.g. aligning objects in pixel-based editor happens too often
         - need Krita's "guide lines"
  - find out common requests that require other programs e.g. dropshadow:
    http://people.kde.nl/marco.html

* look at new backend for 16-bit, translucency, 8-bit paletted with alpha
  - convince Qt to implement 8-bit paletted with alpha?
    - Very important for DOS/SDL-Linux game "Clarence's Adventure"
  - QImage-based renderer; test ->QPixmap conversion speed, look at Krita
    to see how speed, timer-based updater?
  - does premultiplied format
    - lose quality?  don't think so since 16-bit values
    - when set alpha to 0, color dies?  is this so important?

* arbitrary brushes



* selection .diff sitting in local checkout for refactoring accidental drag detection

* kpEffectReduceColors::convertImageDepth() must die

* freeform, elliptical selections

* kpdocument.cpp manipulates document using kpPixmapFX instead of kpPainter (for invert?); look for such a TODO
