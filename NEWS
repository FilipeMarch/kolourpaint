KolourPaint 1.2 Series (KDE_3_3_BRANCH)
======================



   * Fix crash due to text box when scaling image behind it




   * Empty text clipboard fixes:
     - Don't get stuck on a wait cursor after attempting to paste empty
       text into a text box
     - Prevent pasting text from creating a new text box if text is empty
     - Prevent copying of empty text box

Version 1.2.1 (2004/10/02)
   * Fix selection regressions introduced in 1.2:
     - Make selection dragging with CTRL work again (copies selection onto
       document)
     - When creating freeform selections, include the starting point; also
       avoids a QRegion crash with constructing 1-point regions
   * Fix other selection bugs:
     - When the user drags very quickly on a resize handle, resize the
       selection instead of moving it
     - Draw resize handles above the grid lines - not below - so that the
       handles are always visible if they are supposed to be there
   * Speed up renderer (most noticeable with diagonal drag-scrolling at
     high zoom)
     - Don't paint anything outside of the view's visible region
       (previously, clipped only on view _widget_ region)
     - Region-aware: paint component rectangles of the update region,
       rather than the bounding rectangle
   * When changing between colour depth and quality widgets in the save
     filedialog, make sure "Convert to:" and "Quality:" are correctly
     rendered (hacking around a Qt redraw glitch)
     [from kolourpaint_1_2_kde3_branch at time of 1.2 release]
   * Update image format associations to all formats supported by KDE 3.3
   * Fix remaining untranslatable strings (closing KDE Bug #85785)
   * Remove unused images in doc directory
   * Update docs (README, NEWS, ...)

Version 1.2 "ByFiat Everytime" (2004/08/18)
   * Add up to 500 levels of Undo/Redo (minimum of 10 levels, maximum of
     500 as long as the total history size < 16MB)
   * Add freehand resizing of image
   * Add freehand smooth scaling of selections
   * [also in 1.0 branch] New icons (Kristof Borrey)
   * [also in 1.0 branch] Prefer Crystal SVG text icons over KolourPaint's
   * [also in 1.0 branch] Add documentation in the KDE Help Centre
   * Add drag scrolling
   * Add "More Effects" dialog:
     - Balance (Brightness, Contrast, Gamma)
     - Emboss
     - Flatten
     - Invert (with choice of channels)
     - Reduce Colours
     - Soften & Sharpen
   * File saving improvements:
     - Support colour depths (optional dithering) and "colour monochrome"
     - Support JPEG quality
     - Realtime file dialog preview with estimated file size
     - Retain PNG metadata
     - Prompt when attempting lossy save
     - Correctly save transparent selections (not as opaque)
   * Dither more often when loading (and pasting) images for better quality
   * Single key shortcuts for all tools and tool options (automatically
     turned off when editing text but can then use Alt+Shift+<key>)
   * Arrow keys now move one document pixel - not view pixel - at a time
     (more usable when zoomed in)
   * Fix selection bugs:
     - Fix duplicate "Selection: Create" undo entries (Bug #5a)
     - Allow redoing of selection operation if border deselected (Bug #5b)
     - Don't print to STDERR when undoing a selection border create
       operation and border has already been deselected
     - [also in 1.0 branch] When pulling a selection from the document,
       only set the bits of the document to the background colour where the
       transparent selection is opaque in the same place (this is only
       noticeable with colour similarity turned on).  Now moving a
       selection away and then back to its original place is always a NOP
       as it should be.
   * Selections can be deselected using Esc or clicking on icon in Tool Box
   * Accidental drag detection when deselecting selections or text boxes
   * Prevent selection from being moved completely offscreen (at least 1
     pixel of the selection will stay within the view)
   * Speed up copying selection when transparency is on
   * Improve Text Tool usability:
     - Allow single click creation of text box with a sane default size
     - Allow freehand resizing of text boxes
     - Add Opaque/Transparent selector for greater usability and
       consistency with selections
     - Minimum size is now 7x7 document pixels (1x1 - not 4x4 - border)
     - Text cursor doesn't overlap border anymore
     - When dropping text, paste at drop point
     - When MMB pasting creates a new text box, do so at mouse position
   * When MMB pasting text in an existing box, correctly paste multiline
     clipboard contents
   * Improve text quality:
     - With a transparent background, don't antialias foreground opaque
       text with arbitrarily chosen black
     - Make sure transparent text shows up on opaque (usually, grey was
       problematic) background
   * Improve Resize/Scale dialog usability:
     - Add Smooth Scale (useful for creating screenshot thumbnails)
     - Allow manipulating image when selection is active
     - Operation choices stand out as massive, easily clickable buttons
     - Default focus on operation choices
   * Warn if Resize/Scale, Rotate or Skew will take lots of memory
   * Limit startup image size to 2048x2048
   * Eliminate flicker when scrolling
   * Thumbnail fixes:
     - Reduce flicker when appearing (Bug #2)
     - More reasonable minimum size (actually enforce it)
     - [also in 1.0 branch] Use deleteLater()
     - [also in 1.0 branch] Save geometry even if it's closed very quickly
       after a geometry change
   * Restore last used tool and tool options on startup
   * Add Export, Copy To File, Paste From File, Paste in New Window,
     Full Screen Mode
   * Add Zoom In/Out buttons to main toolbar
   * Rename Crop options in an attempt to reduce confusion:
     - "Autocrop" --> "Remove Internal Border" when selection active
     - "Crop Outside Selection" --> "Set as Image (Crop)"
   * "Set as Image" changes:
     - Enable for text boxes
     - Underneath transparent bits of selection, fill image with
       transparent rather than with background colour
   * Permit "reloading" of an empty document
   * Fixes when the current URL doesn't exist:
     - Don't reload if underlying file disappeared
     - Don't add non-existent file to Recent Files history
     - Ask to save before mailing or setting as wallpaper
   * Only enable Show Path when there is a URL
   * Pop up dialog (instead of printing to STDERR) and disable Edit/Paste
     on CTRL+V if the clipboard contents disappeared due to the source
     application quitting (and Klipper didn't retain clipboard contents)
   * Image/Clear now always sets _everything_ within the selection boundary
     to the background colour - including transparent pixels
   * Add Preview button to Colour Similarity Dialog to work around Bug #4
     regarding spinboxes and enter key
   * Colour Picker disallows trying to pick colour outside of image
   * Make sure colour palette contains valid and visible colours at 8-bit
   * [also in 1.0 branch] Fix (big) memory leak on kpSelection destruction
     (Albert Astals Cid)
   * Don't leak image dialogs' memory
   * [also in 1.0 branch] Don't let C++ destruct the mask bitmap before its
     painter when dbl-clicking the color eraser does NOP (avoids
     QPaintDevice and X error)
   * [also in 1.0 branch] Check for QImageDrag::canDecode() before calling
     QImageDrag::decode() (prevents X and valgrind errors)
   * [also in 1.0 branch] Fix compilation problem with QT_NO_ASCII_CAST
     (Waldo Bastian)
   * [also in 1.0 branch] Decrease application preference to below that of
     a viewer (Stephan Kulow)
   * Remember dialog dimensions
   * Remove double dialog margins
   * Fix missing i18n()'s
   * Fix some untranslatable strings
   * [also in 1.0 branch] Corrected several strings
