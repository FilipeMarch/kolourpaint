This file lists known bugs in the 1.??? release that are not considered
"release critical" and are difficult to fix:


1. Flicker when zooming in/out.

3. Tool Box & Colour Box RMB ToolBar Menus do not work.

4. Image dialog spinboxes should accept Enter Key (instead of the dialog's
   OK button) after the user has typed something.

      OR

   Spinboxes should signal that their values have changed every time the
   user changes the text (rather than after pressing Enter or clicking on
   another spinbox etc.).

   The need for the "Update Preview" button and the difficulty of keeping
   the percentages and dimensions in sync in the Resize / Scale dialog are
   manifestations of the current QSpinBox behaviour.

5. If you drag out a selection, manipulate it (e.g. move), undo and then
   manipulate it again, another "Selection: Create" is put into the undo
   history.  A related bug: drag out a selection, move, undo & deselect.
   Attempting to redo does nothing since the selection has no pixmap.

6. a) The undo history and document modified state are not updated during
      the drawing of multi-segment shapes (Polygon, Connected Lines,
      Curve).  They are however updated after shapes' completion.

   b) The text and brush-like tools set the document modified flag even if
      user cancels the draw operation.

7. Certain shapes may have the wrong size (usually only a pixel off and
   only in extreme cases) e.g. an ellipse of height 1 always has a width 1
   pixel less than it should be.  This is a Qt bug.

8. At zoom levels that aren't multiples of 100%, parts of the image may
   appear to move when the user interacts with it.  Other minor redraw
   glitches may also occur at such zoom levels.

9. Keyboard shortcut changes do not propagate to other KolourPaint windows
   (but will propagate to future windows).

10. "File/Open Recent" entries are not updated interprocess.

11. The blinking text cursor will "disappear" if you type more text than
    you can fit in a text box.

12. You cannot select only parts of the text you write.

13. Due to a workaround for a Qt bug, writing text with the foreground
    colour set to transparent is incredibly slow.  Write your text in
    another colour and then set the foreground colour to transparent after
    you've finished typing to avoid this issue.

14. The text cursor may be momentarily misrendered when scrolling the view.

16. The Edit/Paste option is not disabled when the clipboard data is lost
    due to the owner terminating (no QClipboard::dataChanged() signal).

17. Using KolourPaint on a remote X display may result in redraw errors
    and pixel data corruption.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following info does _not_ apply to CVS HEAD.  HEAD won't even compile
on KDE < 3.3.  It's only here so that I won't forget to include it in
future backport branches of KolourPaint.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


Issues with Early Versions of KDE 3.x
=====================================

KolourPaint 1.??? runs best on KDE 3.3 and Qt 3.3.  It will compile and
run on earlier KDE and Qt 3.x releases but you may encounter the following
problems:

TODO: mention thumbnail flicker fixed with Qt 3.3 ("2. Flicker when the thumbnail makes its appearance.");
 
Common to KDE 3.0 and KDE 3.1
-----------------------------

1. It is not always possible to copy and paste between 2 instances of
   KolourPaint running different Qt versions.  See QDataStream::setVersion().

2. The "Settings / Show Statusbar" menu is not available.

3. The filedialog filter combobox is editable as part of a workaround for a
   Qt bug (which normally causes a filedialog destruction crash).

4. Alpha channel checks will be performed when opening and pasting images
   even if the appropriate "Do not show this message again" checkbox has
   been ticked (i.e. slower).  Unwanted notifications of low screen depth
   and alpha channel may also be given.


KDE 3.0 specific
----------------

1. Due to the lack of KImageIO::typeForMime(), KolourPaint can only support
   a limited number of output formats (you'll only notice this if you've
   installed more KImageIO formats).

2. The Resize / Scale Dialog's percentage input fields are missing the
   spinbox arrows.

3. The keyboard modifiers may get out of sync with reality in certain
   corner cases.

4. The "Settings / Toolbars" menu is not available.

5. The "Settings / Configure Toolbars..." dialog does not allow you to
   configure the Main Toolbar.


KDE 3.1 specific
----------------

1. The Tool Box buttons are not clearly rendered in early versions of the
   Keramik style (such as the one included in KDE 3.1).  It may be hard to
   see what tool is currently selected.  Either upgrade to KDE >= 3.2 or
   use another style such as HighColor Classic or Plastik.
