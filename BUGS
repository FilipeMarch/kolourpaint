This file lists known bugs in the 1.0 release that were not considered "release
critical" (euphemism for "hard to fix"):


1. Insane flicker when zooming in/out.

2. Flicker when the thumbnail makes its appearance.

3. ToolBox & Colour Palette RMB ToolBar Menus do not work.

4. Image dialog spinboxes should accept Enter Key (instead of the dialog's
   OK button) after the user has typed something.
   
      OR

   Spinboxes should signal that their values have changed every time the user
   changes the text (rather than after pressing Enter or clicking on
   another spinbox etc.).

   The need for the "Update Preview" button and the difficulty of keeping
   the percentages and dimensions in sync in the Resize / Scale dialog are
   manifestations of the current QSpinBox behaviour.


Please report all bugs to Clarence <dang@kde.org>.
