This file lists known bugs in the 1.0 release that were not considered "release
critical" (euphemism for "hard to fix" :)):


1. Insane flicker when zooming in/out.

2. Flicker when the thumbnail makes its appearance.

3. ToolBox & Colour Palette RMB ToolBar Menus do not work.

4. Image dialog spinboxes should accept Enter Key (instead of the dialog's
   OK button) after the user has typed something.
   
      OR

   Spinboxes should signal that their values have changed every time the user
   changes the text (rather than after pressing Enter or clicking on
   another spinbox etc.).

   The need for the "Update Preview" button and the difficulty of keeping
   the percentages and dimensions in sync in the Resize / Scale dialog are
   manifestations of the current QSpinBox behaviour.

5. If you drag out a selection, manipulate it (e.g. move), undo and then
   manipulate it again, another "Selection: Create" is put into the undo
   history.

6. The undo history is not updated during the drawing of multi-segment
   shapes (Polygon, Connected Lines, Curve).  It is however updated after
   their completion.

7. Certain shapes may have the wrong size (usually only a pixel off and only
   in extreme cases) e.g. an ellipse of height 1 always has a width 1 pixel
   less than it should be.  This is a Qt bug.

8. At zoom levels that aren't multiples of 100%, parts of the image may appear
   to move when the user interacts with it.  Other minor redraw glitches may
   also occur at such zoom levels.

9. Keyboard shortcut changes do not propagate to other KolourPaint windows
   (but will propagate to future windows).

10. "File/Open Recent" entries are not updated interprocess.


System Dependent Issues
=======================

KolourPaint runs best on KDE 3.2 with Qt 3.2.  It will compile and run on
earlier KDE and Qt 3.x releases (TODO: I haven't ported it yet) but you may encounter the following problems:

1. The Tool Box buttons are not clearly rendered in early versions of the
   Keramik style (such as the one included in KDE 3.1).  It may be hard to
   see what tool is currently selected.  Either upgrade to KDE 3.2 or use
   another style such as HighColor Classic or Plastik.


Please report all bugs to Clarence Dang <dang@kde.org>.
