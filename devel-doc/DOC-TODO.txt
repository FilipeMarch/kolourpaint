kpCommnd can only exist while there is a kpDocument and kpView and kpViewManager and kpTool.
However, a kpSelection might not exist.  This is a good idea as to what accessors may return null pointers.

kpCommand and kpDocument are not GUI classes.  They should not access the kpMainWindow, kp*ToolBar or kpTool.

kpTool creates kpCommand.

Test case:
kolourpaint doesnotexist.png
[optional modification of image]
CTRL+S forces a dialog open because it does not know what format it should
be saved in.


KolourPaint saving also handles KImageIO writer not existing for format.
