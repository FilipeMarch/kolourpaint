Licensing
~~~~~~~~~

KolourPaint/KDE3 is under the BSD license since we want the code to be
usable by anyone, for anything.  This includes closed-source derivatives
but actually, the main motivations are to allow:

1.Moving of generic code into an LGPL library (you cannot do this with the
GPL if the copyright is diluted and those other copyright holders disappear
or stubbornly refuse to relicense)

2.Reuse of the code in BSD projects, that don't agree with GPL licensing
(which might be due to either die-hard philosophy and/or Reason 1).

The great thing about the BSD license is that if you don't agree with it,
you can make a fork under the GPL license.  In contrast, if you license
under the GPL to start with, no one can fork it under the BSD license if
they disagree with you.

It is possible to add MIT/X11 licensed code since it's equivalent to
BDD.

KolourPaint/KDE4 adds LGPL code into a runtime library to avoid
infecting the BSD code.

There are ways to incorporate GPL code by introducing a plugin system,
that has the intent of supporting arbitrary plugins but "just happens"
to support a plugin containing the GPL code in question.  This must
be done with caution and probably only works with GPLv2.

Contrary to popular belief, the GPL does not prevent closed-source
derivatives from being created as long as there is only one copyright
holder or all copyright holders conspire together.
