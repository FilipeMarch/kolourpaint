In recent X servers (e.g. CentOS 5), 24-bit screens seem to expose 32-bit
visuals, rather than 24-bit visuals, presumably to support full-blown
alpha blending.

Assuming, /trunk/qt-copy/patches/0182-argb-visuals-default.diff
(KDE SVN -r720997 -- a copy is in this directory; it was reverted -r720998
but I expect it to find its way back into Qt4) is applied:

This causes problems in KolourPaint since 32-bit QPixmap's always report
that they have alpha channels, which means that QPixmap::mask() must
do an expensive reduction of the alpha channel every time it's called.
KolourPaint's abstract drawing pattern and much other code, which are
designed to yield the same output with or without XRENDER, call mask()
frequently.  This is too slow.

Either we add a 32-bit-image code path to KolourPaint (would take weeks)
or we make mask() fast again by changing to a 24-bit visual.  To do that,
we disable XRENDER.
