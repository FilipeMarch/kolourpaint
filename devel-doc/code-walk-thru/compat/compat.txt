Hacks around Qt and KDE library bugs (until they're fixed).


This is also a good place to put in code that allows KolourPaint to
run under older versions of KDE (for standalone backport releases).  If,

may be compiled against 4.0, you can put that class in here as long as
it's BSD licensed.  Otherwise, put it in a new folder lgpl/compat/.
