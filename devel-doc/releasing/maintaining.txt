Welcome Maintainer (or Forker and it also depends how you pronounce it :P)!
You must read this before every release.

The idea as maintainer is that you have a _complete_ idea of the state of
KolourPaint every so often (mandatory before a release) in every active
branch -- see code-walk-thru/resources.txt for descriptions of each branch.

To reduce your workload, stop supporting a branch.  Add a file
"BRANCH_STATUS" to the dead branch explaining the situation.


For each release (whether tagged by KDE or as a standalone release),
for each active branch (even if the branch is not going to be released
soon):

1. "svn log -v" to find out what has happened since you last knew the
   state of the branch (branches/kolourpaint/control/stamp helps here).

   Review every commit after the last known good state.  Reject, change
   and/or port the changes to other relevant branches.

   Act on TODO.

   To help keep track of this, use the KDE Commit Filter and watch all
   active branches.

2. Run scripts/find_issues_before_release.sh and check that those assumptions
   still hold.

3. Go through your inbox, kde-apps.org, sf.net/projects/kolourpaint and the
   KDE buglist, fixing what is necessary and collecting feedback into TODO &
   credits into AUTHORS.

4. Update all docs (README, NEWS, BUGS etc.).
   Increment version number unless there are _absolutely_ no changes
   (including text files, docs, kolourpaint.desktop etc.).
