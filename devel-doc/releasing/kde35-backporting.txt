KDE 3.5:

Every so often, an email will be sent to kde-cvs-announce@kde.org (all SVN
commiters are on it) telling every maintainer to get ready for the next
stable release.

You need to "svn update" KolourPaint and check it still works.  Check that
the changes since the last release are reasonable.  Forward-port anything
that is missing in the trunk.  Trunk is always supposed to completely
supersede the branch.

Update the version numbers in README and VERSION.

Document all changes in NEWS and
www/sites/www/announcements/changelogs/changelog_branch_3_5.xml.

Run the XSLT command in the .xml to regenerate the changelog.
Check the changelog shows up correctly at
