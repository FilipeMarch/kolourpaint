KolourPaint


This is a concise set of docs for maintaining and modifying KolourPaint.
Highly dynamic, implementation details, and hacks not really worth mentioning,
are described in source code comments.


Future Directions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Major Rewrite [6 months of work]: rewriting the graphics engine to be
device-independent and support 8-bit and alpha

* Implement often requested features

* Continual refinement to make it easier to use

* Steal ideas from other editors

DocBook documentation (kdegraphics/doc/kolourpaint).

hopeless ones.
