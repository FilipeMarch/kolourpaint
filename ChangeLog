This is the master ChangeLog kept in CVS _HEAD_ only.  It contains change
information for _all_ past and present branches.

In contrast, ChangeLog in branches only contains the changes between
releases tagged on the mainline up to (and including) the forkpoint and of
course, its changes.

There will probably be no more releases from this branch.


2004/04/29    KolourPaint 1.0.2

- New icons (Kristof Borrey)

- Added documentation in the KDE Help Centre

- Make the brush tool draw something at size 1x1;
  works around Qt <3.2 bug: drawing 1x1 ellipses does not work
  (brush_1x1_kolourpaint-1.0.1.diff)

- Fix thumbnail-related crashes with Qt/KDE 3.0
  - Crash on thumbnail close with accelerator (pending events in event loop)
  - Crash on mainwindow close if the thumbnail was ever closed
    (QDockWindow didn't remove itself from QMainWindow::dockWindows() list)

- Save thumbnail geometry even if it's closed very quickly after a geometry
  change

- When pulling a selection from the document, only set the bits of the
  document to the background colour where the transparent selection is
  opaque in the same place (this is only noticeable with colour similarity
  turned on).  Now moving a selection away and then back to its original
  place is always a NOP as it should be.

- Fix (big) memory leak on kpSelection destruction (Albert Astals Cid)

- Don't let C++ destruct the mask bitmap before its painter when
  dbl-clicking the color eraser does NOP (avoids QPaintDevice and X error)

- Corrected several strings

- Fix compilation problem with QT_NO_ASCII_CAST (Waldo Bastian)

- Decrease application preference to below that of a viewer (Stephan Coolo)


2004/03/06    KolourPaint 1.0.1

- Backport to KDE 3.0 & 3.1; KolourPaint 1.0.1 should be functionally the
  same as KolourPaint 1.0 if compiled under KDE 3.2

- Check for QImageDrag::canDecode() before calling QImageDrag::decode()
  (prevents X and valgrind errors)

- Prefer Crystal SVG text icons over KolourPaint's ones


2004/02/29    KolourPaint 1.0 "Seagull"
