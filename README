1. What is KolourPaint?
=======================

KolourPaint is a free paint program for the K Desktop Environment
(http://www.kde.org), the most popular opensource GUI for Unix-based
systems (such as GNU/Linux and FreeBSD).

It aims to be conceptually simple to use, while still providing a
reasonable level of functionality for the average user who just wants
to crop screenshots, draw diagrams and perform simple image editing
tasks.

KolourPaint is written in C++ using the Qt and KDE libraries.  Essentially,
this means that any X11-based Unix system will be able to run it.

This is a Development Version of KolourPaint.  It has KNOWN BUGS.  Read
Section 4 for details.


2. Features (Planned)
=====================

Features include:

- Tools: Color Picker, Pen, Line, Brush, Eraser, Spraycan, Color Eraser,
         Rectangle, Rounded Rectangle, Ellipse, Fill, Curve, Polygon

- Basic image transformations: Resize, Scale, Flip, Rotate, Skew,
                               Convert to Greyscale, Invert Colours

- Selections: Rectangular, Elliptical, Free Form

- Undo/Redo support

- Zoom/Grid/Thumbnail support

- Screenshot/Edit/Save/Set as Wallpaper workflow optimisation

- Transparent Image support

- Support for all file formats provided by KImageIO (BMP, JPEG, PNG, TIFF,....)

The intention of the KolourPaint Project is not provide a monolithic,
unusable Image Editor with support for layers, alpha-blending, obscure
filters and the like.  Instead, the project aims to provide a simple,
usable and "bug-free" paint program for the masses.


3. Why Another Paint Program?
=============================

One particular paint program cannot reliably save, cannot print at all and
has tool options labelled "Not Yet".  Another cannot reliably handle images
the size of a small screenshot.

Another program is notoriously complex and difficult to use, to point
where simple tasks - such as drawing lines - become impossible for the
ordinary user.

With Linux becoming more widespread, there is a growing demand for quality
applications that supersede commercial alternatives in both usability and
functionality.  KolourPaint aims to fill this void in the area of free
paint programs.


4. Why then is KolourPaint so buggy and incomplete - isn't this HYPOCRISY?
==========================================================================

If you are reading this you are using a CVS/Development version of
KolourPaint that has not even reached the 1.0 mark.  This is NOT an official
release, nor is it intended for production purposes.

It is anticipated that a _polished_ 1.0 release will be available within
3 months.  It won't be yet another paint program that can't Undo/Redo.

Until then, please consider helping out with code, documentation and/or
donations.  The file TODO contains a list of planned and unfinished tasks.


5. Contact
==========

Feel free to email me - Clarence <dang@kde.org> - about anything related to
KolourPaint.  I will endeavour to respond to your email within 2 days, but
sometimes, during busy periods, I may take up to 10 days.  In general, I do
not rudely ignore email so if you don't get a response within 10 days, your
mail has probably been eaten by a blackhole/mail server misconfiguration/
overly-aggressive spam filter.
