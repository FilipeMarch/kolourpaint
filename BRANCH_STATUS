The KDE 3.4 branch of KolourPaint is unmaintained, due to a lack of time.
No more changes will be made in this branch, except for security fixes.

The last change we merged in, from the latest stable branch of KDE (3.5), was:

    r613815 | dang | 2006-12-15 21:27:53 +1100 (Fri, 15 Dec 2006) | 16 lines
    Changed paths:
        M /branches/KDE/3.5/kdegraphics/kolourpaint/

If you must use KDE 3.4, you should manually merge in later fixes from the
latest stable branch (KDE 3.5).
