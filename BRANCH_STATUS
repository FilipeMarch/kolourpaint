This KolourPaint 1.2_kde3 branch (a backport of KDE 3.3's KolourPaint to
KDE 3.0, with scripts to create distro-independent binaries) is unmaintained,
due to:

1. A lack of time.  I didn't even get time to do a backport branch of
   KDE 3.5's KolourPaint.

2. Our cousin branch of KolourPaint (KDE 3.3) became unmaintained.

3. Everyone is using kdelibs 3.5 by now so there is no need for
   kdelibs 3.[012] support.

4. KDE 4 is the future.

5. These days distributions do a much better job of providing packages and
   also, the workload involved in creating distro-independent packages
   by myself became too high.

The last change we merged in, from our cousin branch of KDE (3.3) [which was
marked as unmaintained after that commit], was:

         drag-scaling the selection (Bug 117866)

          history, finalize the smooth scale so that the "m_smoothScaleTimer"

    [BACKPORT of fix to branches/KDE/3.[45]/]

    Needs backporting to branches/kolourpaint/1.2_kde3/ and
    forward porting to trunk/KDE/ (KDE 4).  We lazily claim in the NEWS file that
    we've already backported.

    This fix will be in KDE 3.3-based distros distros.

If you are using a KDE older than 3.5, you should upgrade.  Then, there is
no need for this branch from a user perspective.

In case we decide to do a backport and/or distro-independent package again
(perhaps for KDE >= 4.0), it would be useful to diff the KDE 3.3 branch
against us, to obtain the packaging scripts and the few bits of code/magic
that would still be relevant.  But if we never do another backport or
package, this branch contains no value.
