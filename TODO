Before 1.0
===========

why does the toolsToolBar get arranged differently if run under valgrind???

spraycan sizes

make fill style GUI clearer

fix viewUnderMouseCursor() - drags apparently don't gen Enter events

split up massive kpmainwindow class

documentation

working thumbnail view; also maybe shouldn't be a toolbar

icons for some of the Image dialogs

Image menu items as ordinary tools
honour background colour for Skew, Rotate

print preview

config dialogs

add image/x-krl mimetype to kdelibs to fix the save-as-unknown-type problem

session restore

Rethink kpView/kpViewManager design because of:
- flicker
- performance
- difficult selection handling, esp. drawing the selction border

fix selections; implement free-form selection

kptoolwidgetbase - spacing between items, make contentsRect() actual size wanted

kpcolortoolbar setOrientation

fill - can optimise mem usage by deleting kpFloodFill object
       when execute() (don't derive object)
     - can optimise mem usage by detecting single colour fills

brush shape in wrong place if zoom smaller

make ToolToolBar have _flat_, not 3D buttons

still some flicker if:
1. you've used the brush before
2. switch to the rect
3. switch back to brush and move brush onto view
   and old brush momentarily appears in old pos

line: shift + alt doesn't work but alt+shift does

shape selections should support CTRL, ALT, SHIFT

intersect bounding rect with document rect when saving undo info
- e.g. if you drag a large rect bigger than the view, waste a lot of memory
ditto for setTempPixmapAt et. al.

guard all ptr derefs with if (ptr) ptr->whatever
kdError -> KP_PANIC or KMessageBox
wait cursor for slow ops - should it be in kpDocument or in the commands???

transparent images
- will also require an additional colour in the kpColorToolBar

color depth
tool/polygon
tool/curve


After 1.0
==========

ability to specify measurements in pt,mm,cm,m,in instead of just pixels

ruler

grid for zoom levels > 200 but % 100 != 0
zoom levels < 100%

maybe allow editing when a selection is active (selection becomes bounding rect)

DCOP scriptable
