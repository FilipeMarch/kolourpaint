Before each release of KolourPaint and/or KDE, grep sources for
"SYNC" and check that those assumptions still hold.

Look in BUGS, patches/, grep sources for "OPT" & "TODO" and look here:


Feature Plan for 1.0
====================

Short-Term
----------

selections:
- transparent & opaque selections
- tool/text
- paste text (editable after you paste it)

colour similarity option for Fill and Colour Eraser and AutoCrop

lighter checkerboard transparency background in lieu of configurability

clean document features warning messages

bug (something along the lines of): drag out a selection, smear
   undo, move - there's 2 "Selection/Create" Undo entries


------ KolourPaint 1.0 Alpha released ------


Medium Term (2 weeks)
------------------------

brush shape in wrong place if zoom smaller (or scroll with wheel)
Reason: the mouse isn't moving relative to the view (as the view is moving
relative to the mouse instead) so its position stays the same
(relative to the document).
if brush, close, move cursor, new; brush in wrong place
shift+ctrl+alt modifiers can go out of sync

clean up kpmainwindow
- statusbar
- settings menu
- propagation of settings thru mainwindows

config dialogs (look into new kconfig generator)


Long-Term (approx 4 weeks)
-----------------------------

colour depth audit
- do 1-bit pixmaps work? [DONE, I think]
- are we incorrectly using kpDocument::setPixmap() with mono pixmaps? [DONE]
- remember to nuke pixmap alpha channel from foreign sources [DONE]
- use of QImage::setPixel() instead of QImage::setColor() with <= 8-bit pixmaps [DONE]
- do 8-bit pixmaps work?
- are we dithering when converting from QImage -> QPixmap when we shouldn't be?
  esp. when saving


------ KolourPaint 1.0 released ------


Feature Plan for 1.1
====================


Open 800x600 image, Skew, set horizontal to 60, vertical to 30 and play with
vertical and the image flips over!  I'm sure that's not supposed to happen.
Needs investigating.

flexible kpCommandHistory - would virtually solve all the Undo/Redo annoyances
(such as very limited Undo/Redo even though you're making 1 pixel changes)

Image menu items as ordinary tools - e.g. freehand rotate would be nice

selections
- ability to freehand stretch selections
- maybe always have 1 width display of border - try editing a B&W icon to see what I mean

freehand resize document

eraser cursor border should not get magnified

intersect bounding rect with document rect when saving undo info
- e.g. if you drag a large rect bigger than the view, waste a lot of memory
ditto for setTempPixmapAt et. al. (maybe not for selections, still thinking)

a better set of cursors that don't obscure the pixel you're drawing at
(e.g. compare the excellent Brush cursor to the Line Tool's cursor)

warn about lossy saves (e.g. JPEG)

kptoolwidgetbase - spacing between items, make contentsRect() actual size wanted

"brushes / stamps, hopefully configured from an external source.
 I.e. not only slanted lines and points of multiple thickness, but
 arbitrary images." - Dirk Schönberger
I want to avoid making the widgets too complicated but this sounds
like a very neat must-have feature.

kpcolortoolbar - open/save palette

Image/Convert Colour Depth (only be able to dither to colour depths lower
than the current display - limitation of X).  Hmmm, I could understand
going down to mono (image effect) but why would you want to e.g. convert
to 8 bit - if you save in an 8-bit format after that, you'll lose colour
info twice.  Allow saving at different colour depths.

fullscreen

File/Insert as selection
File/Save selection

blur & sharpen
Image/ Contrast, Brightness, ... more image effects
"a simple plugins framework that allows plugins to be written in various
languages (C, Python and Perl being the obvious choices) to allow people to
extend it into the realms of PaintShop Pro without impacting on the core
philosophy of the app, which seems to be simplicity." -- Tom

Performance tuning

Rethink kpView/kpViewManager design because of:
- performance
- problems with the image "sparkling" at zoom levels % 100 != 0
Ideas:
- region-based rendering (for performance)
- do something about this horrible tempPixmap hack (so slooooow)

fix flicker when zooming in/out (Bug #1)
tool to select rectangular area to zoom into

thumbnail doesn't flicker heaps when appearing (Bug #2)
thumbnail has a rectangle that shows the visible mainView area

Edit/Redo as Stretch,
Edit/Redo as Resize

kptoolpreviewdialog shows checkerboard

configurable transparency background

kpDocument::selectionGetMask()
* return existing selection pixmap mask if available
   (TODO: actually, I think this is inconsistent)
   
documentation (assigned to Thurston)


Feature Plan for KDE 3.3
========================

re-enable the ICO write support

multicolumn KToolBar's (Bug #3)


if you undock a vertical toolbar and right click --> Orientation --> Bottom,
it stays vertically oriented

Look at KPixmapIO for QPixmap <-> QImage conversion optimisation
Update: qt-copy/patches/0005-qpixmap_mitshm.patch: "this obsoletes KPixmapIO"


Cool Ideas
==========

KolourPaint at >= 1.0 should be very usable.  So the following are just nice
ideas (or things I should really do :)) that may or may not ever get
implemented:


guard all ptr derefs with if (ptr) ptr->whatever
- also don't store ptrs to e.g. kpDocument as they may go out of date

kdError -> KP_PANIC or KMessageBox
wait cursor for slow ops - should it be in kpDocument or in the commands???

use of QPoint () or QPoint (-1, -1) as a sentinel is worrying since it's a
legal point when dragging out a rectangle

make sure session restore actually works


Killer Feature: with flow tools (pen, brush, spraycan), holding SHIFT forces horizontal drawing;
                CTRL forces vertical - so those of us without perfectly steady hands
                can still draw straight without continually hitting the Undo button :)

fill - can optimise mem usage by deleting kpFloodFill object
       when execute() (don't derive object)
     - can optimise mem usage by detecting single colour fills

ability to specify measurements in pt,mm,cm,m,in instead of just pixels

ruler

grid for zoom levels > 200 but % 100 != 0

maybe allow editing when a selection is active (selection becomes bounding rect)

shape selections should support CTRL, ALT, SHIFT to alter shape but
ATM, CTRL means copy, SHIFT means sweep.  Maybe have a "Selection Mode" and a
"Drawing Mode"?

DCOP scriptable

offer to save Undo/Redo QPixmap's as PNGs to save memory

Edit/Find a particular colour

allow user to hide Tool Box & Colour Palette if they really insist

"Open documents in the same window" mode - goes against what most KDE apps do
but it is convenient sometimes

colour palette shows frequently used colours for the current image

tool/ruler (can even measure length & angle of diagonal lines)

readonly mode

network friendly - async save

Edit/Paste in New Window; if !kpMainWindow::shouldOpenInNewWindow(),
it should resize the existing view to fit the selection (most useful if
view is too large since we already enlarge view if too small with
ordinary Edit/Paste anyway) - maybe we'd have to rename the action in
this case (but wouldn't an action with 2 names be confusing?).

line: shift+alt doesn't work but alt+shift does
- doesn't look like Bug #64019
- alt alone is backfiring anyway (conflicts with kwin)
  so I'll just leave 30deg & 60deg lines as hidden functionality for now
  (until I can think up a better key combo/way to activate it)

Colour Eraser as part of the Image Menu? You can dbl-click on the tool after all.

On open, dither alpha channel to mask?
