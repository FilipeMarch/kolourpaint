Currently Underway
==================

clean up kpmainwindow

config dialogs (look into new kconfig generator)

fix selections; implement free-form selection
- clean interface
- drastically improve performance
- Undo/Redo
- transparent & opaque selections

Image menu items as ordinary tools
honour background colour for Skew, Rotate

Colour Eraser as part of the Image Menu;
dbl-click on Colour Eraser does whole image?

tool/text
paste text (editable after you paste it)

Killer Feature: with flow tools (pen, brush, spraycan), holding SHIFT forces horizontal drawing;
                CTRL forces vertical - so those of us without perfectly steady hands
                can still draw straight without continually hitting the Undo button :)

Zoom zooms into/out of the centre, not the top-left (like a camera)


Before 1.0
===========

if you undock a vertical toolbar and right click --> Orientation --> Bottom,
    it stays vertically oriented

random pixels in the view showing up with the Colour Eraser Tool and Zoom over a remote display

tool widget colours hard (i.e. impossible) to see on an 8-bit display

spraycan sizes

make fill style GUI clearer

documentation

working thumbnail view; also maybe shouldn't be a toolbar

icons for some of the Image dialogs

session restore

Rethink kpView/kpViewManager design because of:
- flicker
- performance
- difficult selection handling, esp. drawing the selction border

kptoolwidgetbase - spacing between items, make contentsRect() actual size wanted

kpcolortoolbar - open/save palette

fill - can optimise mem usage by deleting kpFloodFill object
       when execute() (don't derive object)
     - can optimise mem usage by detecting single colour fills

brush shape in wrong place if zoom smaller

still some flicker if:
1. you've used the brush before
2. switch to the rect
3. switch back to brush and move brush onto view
   and old brush momentarily appears in old pos

line: shift + alt doesn't work but alt+shift does

intersect bounding rect with document rect when saving undo info
- e.g. if you drag a large rect bigger than the view, waste a lot of memory
ditto for setTempPixmapAt et. al.

guard all ptr derefs with if (ptr) ptr->whatever
- also don't store ptrs to e.g. kpDocument as they may go out of date

kdError -> KP_PANIC or KMessageBox
wait cursor for slow ops - should it be in kpDocument or in the commands???

transparent images
- will also require an additional colour in the kpColorToolBar

tool/curve

network friendly:
- file dialog authentication - pass around mainwindow widget
- async save

tool icons - if a more experienced artist doesn't offer to draw new ones,
I'll be forced to redo them myself once transparency is supported

colour depth audit
- do 8-bit pixmaps work?
- are we incorrectly using kpDocument::setPixmap() with mono pixmaps?

rewrite colour eraser
- faster
- rwlbuis' test


After 1.0
==========

KolourPaint at 1.0 should be very usable.  So the following are just nice
ideas that may or may not ever get implemented:


ability to specify measurements in pt,mm,cm,m,in instead of just pixels

ruler

grid for zoom levels > 200 but % 100 != 0
zoom levels < 100%

maybe allow editing when a selection is active (selection becomes bounding rect)

shape selections should support CTRL, ALT, SHIFT to alter shape but
ATM, CTRL means copy, SHIFT means sweep.  Maybe have a "Selection Mode" and a
"Drawing Mode"?

DCOP scriptable

"a simple plugins framework that allows plugins to be written in various
languages (C, Python and Perl being the obvious choices) to allow people to
extend it into the realms of PaintShop Pro without impacting on the core
philosophy of the app, which seems to be simplicity." -- Tom

offer to save Undo/Redo QPixmap's as PNGs to save memory

colour depth - limitation of X

Edit/Find a particular colour

fullscreen
allow user to disable Tool Box & Colour Palette if they really insist

"Open documents in the same window" mode - goes against what most KDE apps do
but it is convenient sometimes

File/Insert as selection
File/Save selection

colour palette shows frequently used colours for the current image

blur & sharpen

readonly mode

Edit/Paste gives the option of resizing the view to the size of the pasted selection
