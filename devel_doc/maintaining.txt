Welcome Maintainer (or Forker and it also depends how you pronounce it :P)!
This is probably the first file you should read.  You must read this before
every release.

The idea as maintainer is that you have a _complete_ idea of the state of
KolourPaint every so often (mandatory before a release) in every active
branch:

trunk/KDE/kdegraphics/{doc/,}kolourpaint
* In an unknown state ATM

branches/KDE/3.5/kdegraphics/{doc/,}kolourpaint
* Releaseable except for version number change, used for any future KDE 3.5
  releases

branches/KDE/3.4/kdegraphics/{doc/,}kolourpaint
* Releaseable except for version number change, used for any future KDE 3.4
  releases

branches/KDE/3.3/kdegraphics/{doc/,}kolourpaint
* Releaseable, used for any future KDE 3.3 (unlikely)

branches/kolourpaint/1.2_kde3/
* Releaseable

To reduce your workload, stop supporting a branch.  Add a file
"BRANCH_STATUS" to the dead branch explaining the situation.  Dead
branches:

branches/kolourpaint/1.0/

Note: Debian currently uses the 3.3 branch so you had better support it
until the next release!


For each release (whether tagged by KDE or as a standalone release),
for each active branch (even if the branch is not going to be released
soon):

1. "svn log -v" to find out what has happened since you last knew the
   state of the branch (branches/kolourpaint/control/stamp helps here).

   Review every commit after the last known good state.  Reject, change
   and/or port the change to other relevant branches.  You must be
   paranoid else an unwanted change will slip through or a wanted change
   will not be backported.

   Act on TODO.

   To help keep track of this, use the KDE Commit Filter (google it) and
   watch all active branches.

2. Grep sources for "SYNC" (assumptions on compilation and run environment)
   & "sync:" (assumptions between >= 2 bits of code) and check that those
   assumptions still hold.

3. Go through your inbox, kde-apps.org, sf.net/projects/kolourpaint and the
   KDE buglist collecting feedback into TODO and credits into AUTHORS.

   The KolourPaint policy is: anyone who contributes an idea or reports a
   bug deserves a mention in the credits even if the idea/bug has been
   suggested by someone before and/or even if the idea appears ridiculous.

   You will not believe the lengths some people go to, to get into the
   credits.  KolourPaint will make it easy for those people, encourage
   feedback and keep everyone happy :)

   Update AUTHORS if this is trunk/KDE/ (not in branches as it would be
   too painful and might encounter message freeze issues).

4. Update all docs (README, NEWS, BUGS etc.).
   Increment version number unless there are _absolutely_ no changes
   (including text files, docs etc.).

Loop until this reaches a stable state.
