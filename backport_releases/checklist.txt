QT_HAVE_MAX_IMAGE_SIZE // An extension made by SUSE to Qt :-(((
QImage::maxImageSize(); defaults to 4096 as max width and height could cause trouble

how about make bin first, then RPM that to fix KDE /usr or /opt/kde3 issues

docs for bin dist not work on debian - suspect different path and need better use of kde-config --docprefix or something

audit docs for refer to common:/ e.g. kde-defualt.css

[LO] fix antialising e.g. Courier [Adobe] antialiases in KWrite but not KolourPaint but Luxi Mono works in KolourPaint so it's probably the font selection i.e. that KFontSelect box that's wrong

add people (ideas, packagers) into credits

Update kolourpaint.desktop
- translations from branch
- MimeType= line

update templates/kdegraphics/kolourpaint.pot
update i18n

update dist/doc (check kde-default.css hasn't changed in CVS etc. in KDE_3_3_BRANCH)

get kde-common from branch

make sure tux & celery clocks are in sync to prevent build issues

export APBUILD_DEBUG=1    # to see what link against
export CXX=/usr/local/bin/apg++
export CC=/usr/local/bin/apgcc
next time you do a bin package, use --disable-debug, --disable-rpath; maybe --enable-final

Note that a "RPATH       ${ORIGIN}/../lib" is OK even though I asked for no
-rpath at all (actually it's desirable if I need to dynamically link Krita lib
in future :)).  Just as long as RPATH doesn't contain an abs path like
/usr/lib/qt3

check static links for security fixes -lXinerama

do .lsm and figure out sending to KDE FTP

Continue on to packaging with checkinstall.txt
